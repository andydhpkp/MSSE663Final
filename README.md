# FinalApp663

I attempted to build an application that made use of the USDA API, but I had too much trouble figuring our how to connect to it. I then changed the idea to just tracking a meal plan made by a user, and I built a fake backend to practice with. While I found enough success with the fake backend for registering users, when I attempted to build my first interactions with a database and API, I ultimately came up short and did not finish.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
